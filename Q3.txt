Problem 3:
No need to write a program. Just pseudocode is enough

Define a class for a instagram post. Define the properties and functions.
Define which one will be private and which one public.

Write sql query from the following student table
id      name     city        pincode     age
1       Aravind  MAA         112         19
2       ragul    MAA         113         20
3       sree     MDU         021         19
4       krishna  TRI         022         22

Print the list of name from  MAA 
Count the no of people from TRI
Count the no of people in each city
Print the avg age of the students in this table

Solution:

SELECT name FROM student WHERE city = 'MAA';

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student WHERE city = 'TRI';

SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM student GROUP BY city;

SELECT AVG(age) FROM student;
