Problem 3:
No need to write a program. Just pseudocode is enough

Define a class for a instagram post. Define the properties and functions.
Define which one will be private and which one public.

public property:
like
comment
user name
posts
story


private property:
user_id
user_location
e-mail_id
mobile_No

class Instagram:

    def __init__(self, username, , posts, story, likes, email, phone):
        self.username = username  # Public property
        self.posts = posts  # Public property
        self.story = story  # Public property
        self.likes = likes  # Public property        
        self.email = email  # Private property
        self.phone = phone  # Private property
        self.location = location  # Private property
